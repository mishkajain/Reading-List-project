# Books and Reading Progress Tracking Application

This application allows a user to keep track of what books they are 
currently reading and the progress they have made in completing each book.
Some **features** include a system which allows a user to add or remove books 
to a list of books that they want to keep a track of and system where a user
can create general reading goals and book specific targets. 

Anyone who is looking for a way to keep track of what books they are reading,
how much of each book they have read, create reading lists, etc. can use this 
application. Any user, whether they are already an avid reader, or someone who is 
looking for a way to create and sustain better reading habits, can use and will 
benefit from this application. 

As an avid reader myself, I often find it difficult to keep track of which books 
I'm currently reading, which books I want to start reading and which books I've
finished reading. As much as I like to read, there are times when I don't read 
any of the books I started reading for pleasure for weeks on end. Having a system
which allows you to create a goal and displays how much of it I have completed and
how I can reach my target can be very helpful in creating better habits.
